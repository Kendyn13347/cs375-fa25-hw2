Challenges that I faced 
In this assignment, I learned a lot about working with pointers and memory. I had to really understand how linked lists use *next pointers and be careful not to dereference NULL or forget malloc/free. It also helped me see the differences between stack, heap, and static memory. I got experience with system calls like getrlimit(), including how to handle “infinite” values and how limits can vary depending on the OS. Writing a Makefile taught me how to avoid long gcc commands and manage dependencies so everything recompiles correctly. Debugging in GDB was a challenge, but stepping through code, checking the stack, frames, and registers gave me a better picture of what’s happening in memory. Rebuilding the wc tool made me think about things I usually take for granted, like how to count words, handle stdin, and deal with empty input or extra spaces. Overall, this assignment helped me connect high-level C code with low-level details like recursion growing the stack and malloc placing data on the heap.
